# JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)
===================

OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) is   invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java  and modified  in  DOTWEB3.0 P.L in year  2016.And now at year 2025, it's Further modified  at  CH$ P.L instead of java.


 Note: 
 ====
 The  Meaning  of  OAKJAVA7 or  JAVA7.0   is  OAK +  Jemin  Advanced Virtual Machine  OAK  gives   the  meaning  Beginning.

History about creation of Oakjava7 Compiler
===========================================

How Oakjava7 is invented?
=========================

OakJava7 is invented by Wilmix Jemin J by Dotweb3.0 Programming language in
Dotweb3.0 and java.But now the Java Implementation is changed to CH$ P.L.
Because there is no code security in Java/J2ee when i create the Oakjava7 compiler.
So the Oakjava7 implementation is changed to CH$ P.L.
We know the fact  Dotweb3.0 is invented in CH$ and
CH$ is invented in GDollar P.L.

Evidence for creation of Oakjava7 compiler
==========================================

Dotweb3.0 is more advanced than any existing
programming language in today's IT world.

 How to write Dotweb program to create oakjava7 compiler is given below...?
 ==========================================================================


CoreJavac7.web7
==============

<DOTWEB3>
<PACK> Javac7

{
<CLASS> OakJava7c
  {
          public void main()

        {
 <TRY>

      {

//wilmix code

//Console Design

//If no input it will list how to use Oakjava7 compiler.

 if (args.Length <= 0)
      {

        <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
         <PRINTLN>("OakJavac7.0(OAKJAVA7) @JeminInformationTechnology (C)  2024  All Rights  Reserved ");
         <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
         <PRINTLN>("To  compile  java7.0 files use  => corejavac7  <filename.java7> ");
           <PRINTLN>("To  compile  oakjava7.0 files use  => corejavac7  <filename.java7> ");
         
           <PRINTLN>("To  compile and   create  a  prototype software use  => corejavac7 <filename.web>");
           <PRINTLN>("To  compile and   create a  DataScience and MachineLearning application use  \n" +
                "=> corejavac7 <filename.oj7ua>");
            
           <PRINTLN>("============================================================================");
      }
      else
//wilmix code

{
// Calling Oakjava7 compiler libraries.
javac7.Javac7.Java7Main(args);

}

}
      }

      <CATCH> (Exception e)

      {
        // print the  errors

        <PRINTLN>("OakJavac7  Error.... "+e);

      }  
    }
        }

    }



Other Evidence about OakJavac7
=============================


OakJavac7 will work without the installation Java Jdk compiler.
That we can see the Screen shot.OakJava7 borrows CJava runtime 
from Gdollar P.L.I will change it later when i release the 
OakJava7 P.L.Also you can see Corejavac7.exe , and Java7 
entirely different and run without installation of Java compiler 
JDK.You can see the ScreenShot for your Reference which given below..

Note:
====

Why we don't publish all the OakJava7 code ?
===========================================

Beecause if the full implementation of Oakjava7 is known to others,so hackers,etc can easily create the compiler
in Dotweb3.0 and they may overtake oakjava7 easily.
Because using Dotweb3.0 P.L one can create the compiler as fast as could.That's why we don't release  Dotweb3.0

	}



But   public void  main() is   used  in OakJava7 program

 

 public void main() is for protection  from hackers.

DEMERITS  of JAVA and  C#

==========================

 

a) JAVA  class  file   has  many demerits  so  any thing  you create  a compiler  in  java

the source  code  can  be  easily  taken  by JAD.

 

b)  C#  (.exe  or  .dll)  source code can  also  be  taken  using  code  reflector.

so   C#  also   fails  in  Code   security.

That's  why   JAVA7.0  came to the picture.

 

OAKJava7(JAVA7.0) is also used  for creating  datastructures 

and    compilers. ie) It is  also used in Research side.

 

 

JAVA7.0  accepts  ".java7"   filename  and  translate  to  .jclass file.

 

that  java  is  said  to  oakjava7  different  from  orginal java.

 

which  is   not understood  by hackers.

 

 

JAVA7.0  loads    .dll in   memory  to create  a  Prototype  software.

 

c) javac7  <filename.java7> and  => will  also   create  .exe  prototype software


which  jdk1.8  or any  java compiler  cannot  do.

ADVANTAGES of JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)

a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and  Dotweb3.0

which java fails completly in code security. 

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 also includes C# oops concepts.

f) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

g)  OakJava7(JAVA7.0)   provides  High  Security when compared to all the  programming  languages.

h) Since it had  100% oops concepts it is ranked as Rank A' Programming language.
Due to the  reasons  given below...

OakJava7  is   focused  on   creating  Prototype  software(when we  used  with Jdollar(CSHELL),used  to  create Gaming and utilities,  used  in  web application  with  java frameworks , used  with  Machine Learning, Datascience ,Single Webpage application , Remote X Application, etc  with  oakjava7 frameworks,  and  it  has  Advanced Oops. It  also  supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it  is Learnable . 

Note : [ World Rank A'  means  Advanced  programming language  when  compare  to  all  the  Programming languages  and   10  times  greater  than   Web1.0 programming  language.]

Top quality software according to wilmixsolomonresearch lab.

i) JAVA7.0 is used with JDollar,CWEB section, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

j)  JAVA7.0  also  provide   Shortest  function Statements  ...

k)  JAVA7.0  is  easy   to  learn  and  focus  . ie) it  is  Learnable  Programming Language...

l)  JAVA7.0   also  had  his   own  shell  prompt  known  as  Java7Shell...

you  can  execute and  run  Java7.0 Programs...

m)  Java7.0  also   focus  on Code  Security.

n)  Java7.0  is  an interactive  Programming Language..

ie)  It  is  used   with  Java  ,  C#  And  other  writ  Programming Languages .. 

Java  and C#  professionals can  easily  focus. 

o)  JAVA7.0  is  focused on MachineLearning,Datascience  ,etc.

p)  JAVA7.0  is  used  with  WNOSQL  Database which  provides  high   security...

q)  JAVA7.0  is used  with  WXML  which  is  very  easy   to  create   Forms ,Reports,etc.It avoids

typing  html  everytime.  

r) JAVA7.0  also   supports   100%  OOPS  concept. So  it  is called as  a  Pure OOPS  Programming Language.

s)  We  can   convert   Java program  to  Oakjava7  Program  by   using  command  ConvertToJava7.

t)  OakJava7   Intermediate Program    is  used   to  test  the  OakJava7  Program  , when  user

done  mistake  in OakJava7 Programming. 

u) OakJava7    is  designed   in such  a  way   that  Java  Programmers  can   easily   follow it.

v)  OakJava7  is  best  in security  side. eg)   when  we use  Machine learning or web application, it  is best  in security side.

w)  OakJava7   will  work  in  Linux  platform like  ubuntu, etc. So write once  and  run any where.

x)  ScrollServer  can  be used  with  Java Frameworks like  Hibernate,  Mybatics, Java Spring,EJB.
We can use this for constructing web application. but Oakjava7 cannot be used with
java Frameworks  like  Hibernate,  Mybatics, Java Spring,EJB. Because Oakjava7 and java/j2ee
are invented in different programming Languages.
eg) Oakjava7 is implemented by Wilmix Jemin j in DOTWEB P.L and Jdk1.6. But 
Java/J2ee  is  implemented by James Gosling in Oak P.L.
Dotweb P.L is used for compiler construction.

so  we   can  call  OakJava7  as an  interactive  programming Language
when we used with scrollserver.

y) OakJava7  is  Good  for  the  Interviewer  to  select  a  rightful candidate.

Z)  To Write  OakJava7  program for  any task it will take  only few  minutes  or

if  it is  a miniproject  we  can  finish  the  mini project  with in 1 hour.

Thus  OakJava7  Programming Language is very  easy, it  saves  time and  cost. So it  is a user friendly  Programming Language.

AA)  OakJava7  Programming Language also compile and  run  the  file  like .web

and .java7   at the same time  using   javap7.exe. 
 

 

 

 

Note: Here only  OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Programming language is  focused.

Explanation 
============

Here when you code the Machine Learning program  using this syntax and compile it using javac7 <filename.oj7ua> , 

it will automatically convert to  Oakjava7 program ie(.web) . And you will get a optimized oakjava7 (.web) code and .exe   and .ojava7 files.

You can also test the  OakJava7 Machine Learning program using generated (.web) code...So when we notice that here <OJ7ML>  act like a OakJava7 user friendly framework. It act like a XML syntax with data present inside it.

This  OakJava7  Machine Learning program (<OJ7ML) will automatically generate (.web). This (<OJ7ML>) 

program has attractive syntax.So it is considered as a OakJava7 advanced framework or 

OakJava7 Machine learning framework. It reduces the pain of writing program for (.web).

And It saves time and  cost.The Full form of <OJ7ML> syntax is "OAKJAVA7MACHINELEARNING". 

It is used for Dynamic Webpages construction ie) DB with GUI + Business Logic and OakJava7 Servlet.

We can also generate .dll  using this syntax by using .dll value as a Type.

So when you include .exe value as a Type means when you compile the oakjava7

it will generate the  .exe files and  .ojava7 files.

 Note: Kindly refer  Oakjava7  Google site...

[Project  Period : 2005  to  2016,2013,2021,2022,2023]


Note: ABout  Oakjava7 is  under  construction.
