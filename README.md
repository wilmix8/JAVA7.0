Note: The  Meaning  of  OAKJAVA7 or  JAVA7.0   is  OAK +  Jemin  Advanced Virtual Machine
OAK  gives   the  meaning  Beginning. 

The Major common syntax  for  oakjava7 is given below..

JAVA7.0  SYNTAX-1  Program  Structure(.web)

=============================================

Beginning  Section  :  <WEB>

Documentation  Section 

Package  Statement;

<USE> Statement;

<PACK> packagename

LOGIC  SECTION

    <CLASS>  <classname>

   {

      public void main()

      {

CLOSE  LOGIC  SECTION

ENDING  SECTION : }

Explanation:

JAVA7.0  Ending  section  is   }  ;  Ending  your  JAVA7.0  program

Documentation  Section   means   you  can  include  description   

with  comments.

Package  statement  means   you   had  to  include  JAVA7.0 program  in  Package  ....

<USE>  statement  to  import  all  the  packages.

Interface   statement   for    supporting   multiple  inheritance.

Logic   section    for   writing   JAVA7.0  logic  with   Class   followed  by main   method .

after  writing logic   close    the  logic   section.  



JAVA7.0  SYNTAX-2  Program  Structure(.java)(Intermediate OakJava7 program)
===========================================================================

Documentation  Section 

Package  Statement;

Import  Statement;

LOGIC  SECTION

    class  <classname>

   {

     protected static void  main(String args[]) 

      {

        <! source  code !>

      }

CLOSE  LOGIC  SECTION

ENDING  SECTION : }

Explanation:
=============

All  JAVA7.0   should   start   with   class  <classname>   

But   protected static void  main(String args[]) is   used   instead   for  

 public  static void  main(String args[]) for  protection  from hackers.

This  Intermediate oakjava7 program is used only for  testing purpose.

All  JAVA7.0   should   start   with   <JAVA7> then after  that  followed  by <CLASS>  <classname>   

But   protected static void  main(String args[]) or <MAIN> is   used   instead   for  

 public  static void  main(String args[]) for  protection  from hackers.

after  writing logic   close    the  logic   section.  









DEMERITS  of JAVA and  C#
==========================

a) JAVA  class  file   has  many demerits  so  any thing  you create  a compiler  in  java

the source  code  can  be  easily  taken  by JAD.

b)  C#  (.exe  or  .dll)  source code can  also  be  taken  using  code  reflector.

so   C#  also   fails  in  Code   security.

That's  why   JAVA7.0  is  focused.

OAKJava7(JAVA7.0) is a  OAK  java7  for creating  datastructures  
and    compilers.


JAVA7.0  accepts  ".java7"   filename  and  translate  to  .class file.

that  java  is  said  to  oakjava7  different  from  orginal java.

which  is   not understood  by hackers.


JAVA7.0  loads    .dll in   memory  to create  a  Prototype  software. 

c) javac7  <filename.java7> and  => will  also   create  .exe  prototype software

which  jdk1.8  or any  java compiler  cannot  do.
