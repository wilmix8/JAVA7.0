# JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)

===================

 


OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) is   invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java  and modified  in  DOTWEB3.0 P.L in year  2016.

 

Note: The  Meaning  of  OAKJAVA7 or  JAVA7.0   is  OAK +  Jemin  Advanced Virtual Machine

OAK  gives   the  meaning  Beginning.

Documentation  Section   means   you  can  include  description  
with  comments.

 

Package  statement  means   you   had  to  include  JAVA7.0 program  in  Package  ....
<USE>  statement  to  import  all  the  packages.
Interface   statement   for    supporting   multiple  inheritance.

CLOSE  OAKJAVA7  SECTION

 

ENDING  SECTION : }

 

Explanation:

=============

 

All  JAVA7.0   should   start   with   class Oakjava7Prog
{ 

 and it should include  the  constructor of OakJava7 program..

 public Oakjava7Prog()
	{
		super();

	}



But   public void  main() is   used  in OakJava7 program

 

 public void main() is for protection  from hackers.

 public  static void  main(String args[]) for  protection  from hackers.

DEMERITS  of JAVA and  C#

==========================

 

a) JAVA  class  file   has  many demerits  so  any thing  you create  a compiler  in  java

 

the source  code  can  be  easily  taken  by JAD.

 

b)  C#  (.exe  or  .dll)  source code can  also  be  taken  using  code  reflector.

 

so   C#  also   fails  in  Code   security.

 

That's  why   JAVA7.0  is  focused.

 

OAKJava7(JAVA7.0) is a  OAK  java7  for creating  datastructures 

and    compilers.

 

 

JAVA7.0  accepts  ".java7"   filename  and  translate  to  .class file.

 

that  java  is  said  to  oakjava7  different  from  orginal java.

 

which  is   not understood  by hackers.

 

 

JAVA7.0  loads    .dll in   memory  to create  a  Prototype  software.

 

c) javac7  <filename.java7> and  => will  also   create  .exe  prototype software

 

which  jdk1.8  or any  java compiler  cannot  do.

s)  We  can   convert   Java program  to  Oakjava7  Program  by   using  command  ConvertToJava7.

 

t)  OakJava7   Intermediate Program    is  used   to  test  the  OakJava7  Program  , when  user

 

done  mistake  in OakJava7 Programming.

 

u) OakJava7    is  designed   in such  a  way   that  Java  Programmers  can   easily   follow it.
